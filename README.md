# Andromeda: Making Government Legislation Accessible 🌌

Welcome to the Andromeda project repository! Andromeda is an innovative tool designed to streamline the process of accessing and understanding newly passed legislative bills from government websites. Our mission is to enhance public awareness and knowledge of governmental actions by providing concise, easily digestible summaries of complex legislative documents.

## Project Overview 📘

Andromeda automates the retrieval and summarization of the latest passed bills from government websites. It ensures that you stay updated without the hassle of navigating through complex legal language or redundant data checks.

### How It Works 🔍

1. **Bill Retrieval**: The program begins by fetching information on the latest passed bills from a designated government website, focusing on essential details like bill titles, passing dates, and direct links to the full texts.

2. **Log Verification**: Before processing, the system checks an internal log to determine if the bill has already been summarized. This step avoids duplicate work and ensures system efficiency.

3. **Text Extraction**: If the bill is new, the program retrieves the complete text of the bill using the provided link.

4. **AI-Powered Summarization**: The raw text of the bill is then processed by a specifically fine-tuned AI agent trained to distill complex legislative language into a simple, clear summary.

5. **Logging Updates**: After processing, the system updates the logs, marking the bill as summarized to prevent future redundancies.

6. **Completion**: With the summary created and logged, the program terminates until new bills are passed and need processing.
